## 🚀 About Me

- 🧠 Experienced in **Kotlin**, **Java**, **Android**, and **Backend systems**
- 🛠 I enjoy exploring and experimenting with the latest tech. There's always something new on the horizon, and I enjoy the challenge of learning. You'll notice a lot of random projects under my repositories because of this.
- 🐙 I started my career as an Android engineer and expanded into distributed systems a bit. I like being able to view and control the entire process from the raw data to the user interface.
- 🐾 Proud dad of 4 cats
